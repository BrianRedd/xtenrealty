Booj Front End Code Test, TEN Realty

* Near pixel-perfect conversion of four PSD files into functional responsive webpage
* Site is responsive with four breakpoints (provided by client)
* As content for links and tabs were not provided (other than the initial "lorem ipsum" under About Me), links have either been left pointing to "#" or contain filler content.
* One exception is the "Denver Office" link, which I took the liberty to populate a modal with a map to the office (in this case, the actual Booj office, as TEN Realty's address is fake).
* Telephone number links are active using the "tel:" target, so can be tabbed on a mobile device to call the number
